* In this project, I analysis the data taken from Kaggle to find the details behind the loss of lives.
* In this data, there are 891 rows and 12 column.
* I analysis the project based on two types of Variables.
  1. Categorical Variable

* Passengers whos age is less than 30 are survied most.
* Passengers who are alone are *NOT* survived comapred to passerger with family.
